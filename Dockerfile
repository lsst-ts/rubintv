# This Dockerfile is used to build the Rubintv on a commit basis.
# The GH action will build the image and push it to the registry.
# The image will be used to deploy the application on dev servers.
# Note:
# I was not able to use the conda recipe to build the image,
# faced several issues which at the end I was not able to resolve
# and decided to use the python image instead.
# This is a temporary solution, and I will work on a better approach
# to build the image using conda.
# TODO: DM-43222.
