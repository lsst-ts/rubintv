  tma:
    Event version number:
      The code version which generated the event. Events only necessarily have the same timespans when their version numbers match!
    Event type:
        The type of event, i.e. was it a regular move (MOVING) or were we tracking the sky (TRACKING)?
    End reason:
        Why did the event end? Did we turn off, stop, go to fault, or change movement type?
    Duration:
        The duration of the event, in seconds.
    Time UTC:
        The start time of the event, as a UTC time string.
    Elevation start:
        The starting elevation value, in degrees.
    Elevation move:
        The total net elevation move, in degrees.
    Largest elevation torque:
        The largest elevation torque during the event, in Nm, including its sign. So, if the largest toque magnitude is a negative one, it will be a large negative value, if the largest toque seen was positive, it will be large and positive.
    Azimuth start:
        The starting azimuth value, in degrees.
    Azimuth move:
        The total net azimuth move, in degrees.
    Largest azimuth torque:
        The largest azimuth torque during the event, in Nm, including its sign. So, if the largest toque magnitude is a negative one, it will be a large negative value, if the largest toque seen was positive, it will be large and positive.
