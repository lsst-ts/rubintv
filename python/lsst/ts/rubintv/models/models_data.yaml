    Delta Dec Arcsec narrow:
      The difference between the commanded and fitted dec, in arcseconds
    Calculated Alt narrow:
      The calculated alt from the astrometric fit. The alt and az are calculated from the fitted ra and dec using astropy, and currently applying nominal refraction correction, i.e. with default values for the pressure, temperature and relative humidity.
    Calculated Az narrow:
      The calculated az from the astrometric fit. The alt and az are calculated from the fitted ra and dec using astropy, and currently applying nominal refraction correction, i.e. with default values for the pressure, temperature and relative humidity.

  tma:
    Event version number:
      The code version which generated the event. Events only necessarily have the same timespans when their version numbers match!
    Event type:
        The type of event, i.e. was it a regular move (MOVING) or were we tracking the sky (TRACKING)?
    End reason:
        Why did the event end? Did we turn off, stop, go to fault, or change movement type?
    Duration:
        The duration of the event, in seconds.
    Time UTC:
        The start time of the event, as a UTC time string.
    Elevation start:
        The starting elevation value, in degrees.
    Elevation move:
        The total net elevation move, in degrees.
    Largest elevation torque:
        The largest elevation torque during the event, in Nm, including its sign. So, if the largest toque magnitude is a negative one, it will be a large negative value, if the largest toque seen was positive, it will be large and positive.
    Azimuth start:
        The starting azimuth value, in degrees.
    Azimuth move:
        The total net azimuth move, in degrees.
    Largest azimuth torque:
        The largest azimuth torque during the event, in Nm, including its sign. So, if the largest toque magnitude is a negative one, it will be a large negative value, if the largest toque seen was positive, it will be large and positive.
