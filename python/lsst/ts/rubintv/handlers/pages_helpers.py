    user: `dict` | `None`
        A dictionary containing user details if the user is in the list for
        having admin privileges. If the user not in the admin list for the
        current location, `None` is returned to indicate restricted access.

        If the location does not enforce access restrictions (i.e. open
        admin access), an empty dictionary is returned.
        This represents a generic, unnamed user who is allowed to
        view the page, but has no identity and won't be greeted by name.

        This distinction allows downstream code to handle three cases:
        - Admin user: full access, user info available in the dict.
        - Non-admin user: access denied, `None` returned.
        - Anonymous access allowed: limited access permitted, empty dict
